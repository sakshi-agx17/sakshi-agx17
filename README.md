## 🌱 My Journey: From Dreams to Data

I'm a graduate student at Arizona State University, but that's just where I am now. Here's how I got here—the real story, with all its ups and downs.

---

### 📍 **2020: The Year Everything Changed**

**Early 2020** - Graduated high school with 90% marks 🎓  
*Skills: Foundation in Math & Science*

Life felt promising. I had good grades, big dreams, and was ready to crack JEE Mains.

**Mid 2020** - Failed JEE Mains by 4% 💔  
*Reality Check: Sometimes your best isn't enough on exam day*

That 4% haunted me. It wasn't a lot, but it was enough to close doors to premier engineering colleges. I questioned everything—my preparation, my intelligence, my future.

**Late 2020** - Enrolled in a government college in Bareilly  
*Skills: Learning to adapt, finding new paths*

This wasn't Plan A. Or Plan B. But I decided: if the door I wanted didn't open, I'd build my own. Started my Bachelor's in Computer Science—determined to prove that college prestige doesn't define capability.

### 📍 **2021-2023: Building from Ground Up**

**The Grind Years** 🔨

With no big college name backing me, I knew I had to *stand out*. So I:

- **Learned Python from scratch** - Late night YouTube tutorials became my classroom
- **Discovered Machine Learning** - My first model had 40% accuracy (yes, really). But I kept going.
- **Started Building Projects** - Each one taught me something new about data, algorithms, and patience
- **Applied for internships** - Got rejected. A lot. But each rejection taught me what skills I was missing
- **Dove into Research** - If companies wouldn't give me a chance, I'd prove myself through research papers

*Skills Gained: Python, SQL, Machine Learning basics, Data Analysis, Resilience*

**2022-2023: The AddictoAlert Era** 💡

Watched my friends (and myself) glued to phones. Realized this was a problem worth solving:
- Surveyed 300+ students (learned that getting people to share personal data requires trust and empathy)
- Built an SVM model to detect smartphone addiction patterns
- Applied statistical methods I'd only read about in textbooks
- **Got selected for C.S.T.U.P. Government Grant** - beating 150+ applicants from premier institutions

*This was my first real validation: I could compete, and win.*

*Skills Evolved: Machine Learning (SVM, Feature Engineering), Survey Design, Statistical Analysis, Research Methodology*

**Published My First Paper** 📝  
"Unraveling Nomophobia" - It wasn't just a publication; it was proof that my work mattered.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building

### Currently Working On 🔨
- **OTIS Central** (Ignite AI): Building ML workflow management interfaces—integrating REST APIs and making complex data accessible
- **Master's Coursework:** Diving deep into Advanced Data Structures, Data Visualization, and AI for Software Engineers
- **Personal Project:** A dashboard that tracks my learning journey and study patterns (meta, I know! 😄)

### What I've Shipped ✅
- **Data Reconciliation Tool** @ Clairvoyant: Identified 50+ discrepancies, improved data integrity by 30%
- **Automated Dashboards** @ Hum Technologies: Reduced monthly reporting time by 20%
- **Video Game Sales Prediction:** 99.39% accuracy with Decision Tree (yeah, I'm proud of this one!)
- **Two Research Publications:** On body fat prediction and smartphone addiction analysis

- How to design scalable ML systems
- Best practices in MLOps and model deployment
- Advanced visualization techniques for storytelling with data

**Recently Clicked:**
- The importance of feature engineering (it's an art and a science!)
- How to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- That coffee is essential for debugging sessions ☕

---

## 📝 Published Work

1. **"ML-based Investigation of Hybrid Regressor Model for Accurate Body Fat and BMI Prediction"** - IEEE
   - Tackled a healthcare problem using machine learning
   
2. **"Unraveling Nomophobia: An Exploratory Data Analysis using Python"** - ISTE
   - Explored the psychology of smartphone addiction through data

---

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to collaborate on:
- 🤖 Machine Learning projects with social impact
- 📊 Data visualization that tells compelling stories
- 🔬 Research in applied ML and behavioral analysis
- 💡 Open-source contributions

**Fun Fact:** I believe the best ML models are built with empathy—understanding not just the data, but the people behind it.
