**🎓 The Reality Check**

Passed 12th grade (90%) → Failed JEE by 4%

Enrolled in a government college. Not the dream start, but a start nonetheless.

**Skills:** Adaptability, Resilience

**Growth:** Learning that detours aren't dead ends

</td>
<td width="200" align="center">

**💻 The Grind Years**

Projects, research papers, and countless rejections

Built AddictoAlert while applying to 30+ internships. Each "no" taught me something new.

**Skills:** Python, Machine Learning, Research Methodology, Pandas, NumPy

**Growth:** Persistence through rejection

</td>
<td width="200" align="center">

**🎢 The Breakthrough & Setback**

Finally landed an internship after dozens of rejections

US study abroad dream fell through despite multiple offer letters. Anxiety kicked in as internship neared its end.

**Skills:** Data Analysis, Tableau, SQL, Professional Communication

**Growth:** Learning to handle uncertainty

</td>
<td width="200" align="center">

**🚀 The Plot Twist**

Something finally worked out → Onboarded to Ignite AI

Decided to give the US dream another shot. Applied to ASU and got the offer.

**Skills:** MLOps, REST APIs, Production ML Systems

**Growth:** Trust the timing

</td>
<td width="200" align="center">

**🌟 The Fresh Start**

Arizona State University - MS in Software Engineering

Hustling for summer internships while diving deep into advanced coursework. The journey continues.

**Skills:** Advanced Data Structures, AI Engineering, AWS, Deep Learning

**Growth:** Embracing the unknown
