### 📍 **2025: The Current Chapter**

<div align="center">

**🎓 Arizona State University - MS in Computer Software Engineering**

*Location: Tempe, Arizona 🌵*

</div>

**Where I Am Now:**

| Morning | Afternoon | Evening | Night |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Classes: Advanced DS, AI, Data Viz | Working with Ignite AI remotely | Building projects | Applying to internships |

**Skills I'm Building:**
- Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures
- Deep Learning & Neural Networks
- AWS & Cloud Computing
- System Design & MLOps
- Building in public (like this README!)

**Current Challenges:**
- Imposter syndrome in a new country ✈️
- Balancing work + studies + internship hunt
- Financial pressure (international student struggles)
- Fighting the rejection cycle again

**What I'm Learning:**
1. Imposter syndrome doesn't disappear with location changes—you just get better at managing it
2. Every "no" is bringing me closer to the right "yes"
3. Building in public is terrifying but necessary
4. The hustle never stops; it just evolves

### 💭 Reflections: What This Journey Taught Me

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**❌ Where I Failed**

- **JEE Mains** → Taught me one test ≠ my worth
- **50+ Rejections** → Taught me persistence
- **40% Accuracy Models** → Taught me iteration
- **First US Attempt** → Taught me patience
- **Self-Doubt Cycles** → Taught me resilience

</td>
<td width="50%">

**✅ Where I Won**

- **Govt Grant** → I can compete with anyone
- **2 Publications** → My research matters
- **Jobs at Hum, Clairvoyant, Ignite** → Timing is everything  
- **ASU Acceptance** → Dreams delayed ≠ denied
- **Still Here** → Survival is success too

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**The Pattern I See:**

```
JEE Failure → Govt College → Had to Stand Out → Built Projects → 
Research Published → More Rejections → Kept Building → 
First Internship → Jobs → ASU → Current Hustle
```

**Nothing was wasted. Every rejection was redirecting me.**

<div align="center">

### 🎯 "I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm grateful I'm not where I used to be."

**From Bareilly to Tempe. From 40% accuracy to published papers. From 50+ rejections to choosing between offers.**

**The journey continues. The hustle never stops. The story isn't over.**
